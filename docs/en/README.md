# Hello Solidity

## About This Project

As a developer with experience in Javascript/Typescript in the Web2 world, I've embarked on a journey to explore Web3 technologies, particularly Solidity for smart contract development. This repository serves two purposes:

1. To document my personal learning process as I transition into Web3 development.
2. To offer fellow developers with similar backgrounds concise and easy-to-understand materials for learning Solidity and smart contract development.

I believe that our Web2 skills provide a strong foundation for understanding Web3 concepts. This project aims to bridge that gap, making the transition smoother for developers like us.
